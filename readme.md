## Future Development 

This is our first version and as such it was focused on meeting the MVC requirements. 
For future development we want to make the site for appealing because so far it seem quite plain. 
We also would like to create a more user friendly members page that allows them to actually search other users.
We might add a location based search tool, so that users can interact with other people near them.
